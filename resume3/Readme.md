## CV Template
Being a Linux user, making a CV has been a bit of a struggle. I have tried using several free templates in Latex, Google Docs, etc. Eventually, I wanted to try and make one in HTML. This is what I ended with. Feel free to use and edit it.

### Note
The color can be changed in cv.css ```--main-color```

Some CSS attributes were adapted from Thomas Hardy's [template](http://www.thomashardy.me.uk/free-responsive-html-css3-cv-template) .
